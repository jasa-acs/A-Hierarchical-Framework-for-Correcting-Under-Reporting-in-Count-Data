## Data 

### Abstract 

The data contained in Data.RData comes from a variety of publicly available sources, and represents the variables used in the tuberculosis model, as well as some additional variables.

### Availability 

The Data.RData file, and associated code, will be made publicly available on a file sharing site such as Dropbox.

### Description 

The tuberculosis data is exclusively from public sources (detailed in the data dictionary) so, to the best of my knowledge, there are no issues with respect to licensing.
I will also include a data dictionary Definitions.docx.

## Code

### Abstract

A collection of R scripts for reproducing the results in sections 4.1 and 4.2.

### Description

The code will be delivered in a .zip file, containing several R scripts. The code can be run from the Master.R script to reproduce all figures found in the article. The script Simulation.R simulated data as seen in Section 3.1. The script Experiments.R reproduces results seen in Section 3.1 and the Appendix. The script Tuberculosis.R reproduces results found in Section 3, while Functions.R contains some miscellaneous functions. These will also be shared publicly on a site such as Dropbox.

### Optional Information

The R packages used by the scripts should be installed and updated before running the code. As well as R, R devtools may also need to be installed to use NIMBLE.

## Instructions for use

### Reproducibility

To be reproduced are all figures. This can be done by sourcing the Master.R script.
